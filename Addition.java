Purpose: application that inputs three integers from the user and displays the
sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers. [Note: The
calculation of the average in this exercise should result in an integer
representation of the average. So if the sum of the values is 7, the average
should be 2, not 2.3333â€¦.]
